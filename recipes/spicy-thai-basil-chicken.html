    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe was created by <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/author/chef-john/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mitzewich</a>. If you don't have Thai or holy basil, it can still be made with regular basil. The sauce acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.
