    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe was created by <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/author/chef-john/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Mitzewich</a>. If you don't have Thai or holy basil, it can still be made with regular basil. The sauce acts like a glaze as the chicken mixture cooks over high heat. The recipe works best if you chop or grind your own chicken and have all ingredients prepped before you start cooking.

      <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>
        1 pound skinless, boneless chicken thighs, coarsely chopped
      </li>
      <li>1/4 cup sliced shallots</li>
      <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>
        2 tablespoons minced Thai chilies, Serrano, or other hot pepper

      <li>1 cup very thinly sliced fresh basil leaves</li>
      <li>2 cups hot cooked rice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Whisk chicken broth, oyster sauce, soy sauce, fish sauce, white sugar, and brown sugar together in a bowl until well blended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat large skillet over high heat. Drizzle in oil. Add chicken and stir fry until it loses its raw color, 2 to 3 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in shallots, garlic, and sliced chilies. Continue cooking on high heat until some of the juices start to caramelize in the bottom of the pan, about 2 or 3 more minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add about a tablespoon of the sauce mixture to the skillet; cook and stir until sauce begins to caramelize, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour in the rest of the sauce. Cook and stir until sauce has deglazed the bottom of the pan. Continue to cook until sauce glazes onto the meat, 1 or 2 more minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in basil. Cook and stir until basil is wilted, about 20 seconds. Serve with rice.
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
